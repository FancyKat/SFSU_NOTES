# Package 01 Review

## Summary of Key Points
- The package is focused on demonstrating basic printing functionalities in Java, including formatted outputs and repetition patterns.
- **Major Functions**:
  - `Printf.java`: Implements formatted printing in Java, showcasing how to output data in various formats.
  - `PrintRepeat.java`: Demonstrates how to repeat certain print operations, potentially useful for generating repeated patterns or data structures.
  - `Print.java`: Basic utility for printing messages to the console, likely serving as a foundational example of Java output.
  - `ProjectHelloWorld.java`: A classic "Hello World" example in Java, emphasizing the basics of program structure and execution.

## Code Analysis

#### Basic Printing (`Print.java`)
- **Objective**: Learn how to print text to the console in Java.
- **Code Example**:
  ```java
  System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  ```
- **Explanation**: `System.out.println` is used to print text to the console, with each call printing on a new line.

#### Looping and Repetition (`PrintRepeat.java`)
- **Objective**: Understand the use of loops to repeat actions in Java.
- **Code Example**:
  ```java
  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      System.out.println("Repeat");
  }
  ```
- **Explanation**: A `for` loop is used to repeat printing "Repeat" to the console five times.

#### Formatted Output (`Printf.java`)
- **Objective**: Learn how to use formatted strings in Java.
- **Code Example**:
  ```java
  System.out.printf("Name: %s, Age: %d", name, age);
  ```
- **Explanation**: `System.out.printf` allows for formatted output, where `%s` is a placeholder for a string, and `%d` is for an integer.

#### Simple Java Program (`ProjectHelloWorld.java`)
- **Objective**: Introduction to writing a simple Java program.
- **Code Example**:
  ```java
  public class ProjectHelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, World!");
      }
  }
  ```
- **Explanation**: Demonstrates the structure of a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
