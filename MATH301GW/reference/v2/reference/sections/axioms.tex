% Axiom concerning the closure property of integers
\subsection{Axiom 1.1}
\textit{Closure under addition: For all \(X, Y \in \mathbb{Z}\), the sum \(X + Y\) is also in \(\mathbb{Z}\).}

% Axiom concerning the existence of an additive identity
\subsection{Axiom 1.2}
\textit{Existence of an additive identity: There exists an element \(0 \in \mathbb{Z}\), such that for every \(X \in \mathbb{Z}\), \(X + 0 = X\).}

% Axiom concerning the existence of additive inverses
\subsection{Axiom 1.3}
\textit{Existence of additive inverses: For every \(X \in \mathbb{Z}\), there exists an element \(-X \in \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(X + (-X) = 0\).}

% Axiom concerning the commutative property of addition
\subsection{Axiom 1.4}
\textit{Commutativity of addition: For all \(X, Y \in \mathbb{Z}\), \(X + Y = Y + X\).}
