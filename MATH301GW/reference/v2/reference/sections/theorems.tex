% Theorem 2.25
\unnumberedsection{Theorem 2.25 (Principle of Mathematical Induction â€” First Form Revisited):}
Let $P(k)$ be a statement, depending on a variable $k \in \mathbb{Z}$, that makes sense for all $k \geq m$, where $m$ is a fixed integer. In order to prove the statement "P(k) is true for all $k \geq m$," it is sufficient to prove:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $P(m)$ is true, and
    \item For any given $n \geq m$, if $P(n)$ is true then $P(n+1)$ is true.
\end{enumerate}
