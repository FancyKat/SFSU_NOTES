\section*{Design and Mockup for Fleet Management Dashboard}

\subsection*{Wireframing}
Before diving into the actual design, wireframing will be used to establish the basic structure and layout of the dashboard. This step helps in defining the placement of elements and the flow of user interactions without focusing on stylistic choices.

\textbf{Key Components to Wireframe:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Navigation bar
    \item Real-time vehicle tracking map
    \item Maintenance alerts section
    \item Analytics and reporting dashboard
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Creating Mockups}
Once wireframes are approved, the next step is to create detailed mockups. These mockups will provide a clearer view of the final design, incorporating colors, fonts, and other design elements.

\textbf{Tools:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Figma or Adobe XD can be used for creating high-fidelity mockups.
    \item Collaboration features of these tools will facilitate feedback and iteration.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Interactive Prototyping}
With mockups in place, an interactive prototype will be developed to simulate user interactions and the flow of the application. This prototype will be used for user testing to gather initial feedback and make necessary adjustments.

\textbf{Prototype Features:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clickable elements to navigate between different views and functionalities of the dashboard.
    \item Simulated data to showcase how real-time information will be presented.
    \item Transition effects and animations to give a realistic feel of the user interface.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Feedback and Iteration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The prototype will be shared with potential users and stakeholders to gather feedback.
    \item Observations and suggestions will be used to refine the design further.
    \item Multiple iterations may be required to finalize the mockups before moving to the development phase.
\end{itemize}
