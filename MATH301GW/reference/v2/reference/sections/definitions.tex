This chapter contains the definitions of mathematical terms and symbols as used in the context of your studies.

\section*{Equality and Inequality}

\subsection*{Definition: Equality "="}
The symbol "=" denotes equality. If we write \(m = n\), we assert that \(m\) and \(n\) are the same numerical value.

\subsection*{Definition: Inequality}
The symbol "\(\neq\)" denotes inequality. The statement \(m \neq n\) asserts that \(m\) and \(n\) are not the same numerical value.

\section*{Set Membership}

\subsection*{Definition: In the Set Of}
The symbol "\(\in\)" denotes membership within a set. For example, the statement \(a \in S\) indicates that the element \(a\) is a member of the set \(S\).

\subsection*{Definition: Not In the Set Of}
Conversely, the symbol "\(\notin\)" denotes non-membership in a set. For example, \(b \notin T\) indicates that \(b\) is not a member of the set \(T\).

\section*{Number Theory}

\subsection*{Definition: Divisibility}
We say that an integer \(m\) is divisible by another integer \(n\) if there exists an integer \(k\) such that \(m = nk\). This is denoted as \(n | m\).

\subsection*{Definition: Even Integers}
An integer \(n\) is defined as even if it is divisible by \(2\). In other words, there exists an integer \(k\) such that \(n = 2k\).

% Include additional definitions from number theory...

\section*{Functions}

\subsection*{Definition: Function (Informal)}
A function from a set \(A\) to a set \(B\) is a rule that assigns each element of \(A\) exactly one element of \(B\). The set \(A\) is called the domain, and the set \(B\) is called the codomain.

\subsection*{Definition: Function (Formal)}
Formally, a function \(f\) from set \(A\) to set \(B\) is defined as a set of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) with the property that each \(a\) in \(A\) is associated with exactly one \(b\) in \(B\). We write this as \(f: A \to B\).
